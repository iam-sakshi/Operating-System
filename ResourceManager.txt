- Interestingly , Computer or any simple electronic device are possible to exist without OS , but then we have to do all task manually 
  If you directly load instructions into memory and start execution, the computer will run them.
  Early computers worked exactly like this — operators gave instructions via switches, punched cards, etc.

- Operating System 
Early 1950s–1960s
Computers originally ran one program at a time, manually loaded by operators.
First OS-like systems were created to automate job scheduling and manage hardware.
-Who introduced it?
It's not credited to one single person, but to early computing labs & companies:
Contributor	Contribution
General Motors Research Lab (1956)	-- First known OS for IBM 701 (GM-NAA I/O)
IBM (late 1950s–1960s)	-- Popularized OS concept (IBM OS/360 in 1964)
University researchers	-- Time-sharing OS ideas (MIT, Bell Labs)

Hardware is considered passive by itself.
it cannot do anything on its own.
It only responds when software gives instructions.
CPU needs instructions (program)
RAM needs data to store
Disk needs commands to read/write
So hardware = capability, software = control & action.

System Software is the software that manages hardware and provides a platform for application software.
It acts as the bridge between user/programs and hardware.
It is ACTIVE unlike hardware is PASSIVE
